# RC4 Encryption and Decryption Program

The RC4 Encryption and Decryption Program is a simple application that allows you to encrypt and decrypt messages using the RC4 encryption algorithm. It provides two modes of operation:

1. Encrypt and Decrypt a Message from a Text File.
2. Encrypt and Decrypt a Manually Entered Message.

## Prerequisites

Before using this program, ensure that you have the following:

- A C++ compiler capable of compiling C++11 or later.
- A text file for reading and writing messages (for option 1).
- Basic knowledge of the RC4 encryption algorithm.

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download the source code to your local machine.

2. Compile the program using your C++ compiler. For example:

   ```sh
   g++ -std=c++11 rc4.cpp -o rc4
   ```

   Replace `g++` with your C++ compiler command if necessary.

3. Run the compiled program:

   ```sh
   ./rc4
   ```

## Usage

The program provides two options:

### Option 1: Encrypt and Decrypt a Message from a Text File

- Enter '1' when prompted.
- Provide the following information:
  - Key file name: Enter the name of the file containing the encryption key.
  - Input file name: Enter the name of the file containing the plaintext message.
  - Output file name: Enter the name of the file where the ciphertext will be saved.

### Option 2: Encrypt and Decrypt a Manually Entered Message

- Enter '2' when prompted.
- Enter the encryption key (between 5 and 32 bytes) when prompted.
- Enter the message to encrypt/decrypt.

## Important Notes

- The RC4 encryption algorithm is sensitive to the key length. Ensure that your key is between 5 and 32 bytes long.

- For option 1, the program reads the key and plaintext message from files and writes the ciphertext to a file.

- For option 2, the program allows you to manually enter the key and message and provides the encrypted result.
